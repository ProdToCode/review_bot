Instructions must be COMPREHENSIVE YET CONCISE, directly addressing the task:\n    - 1.1 The instructions MUST FOLLOW an ORDERED and logical format.\n    - 1.2 IDENTIFY ALL syntax and logic errors in the code.\n    - 1.3 The instructions MUST SUGGEST corrections WITHOUT REPLICATING the Correct Solution code.\n    - 1.4 The instructions MUST FOLLOW best practices of the {programming_language} language.\n2. YOU MUST NOT include corrected code samples or the final solution in the output!\n3. YOU MUST NOT include instructions about removing imports or testing changes!\n4. The output MUST NOT INCLUDE introductory or concluding text and MUST NOT include unessential text.\n5. Use simple language for instructions, and AVOID complex vocabulary or formal expressions.\n6. The output MUST IMMEDIATELY STOP at the end of the last instruction WITHOUT including ANY additional text!"
